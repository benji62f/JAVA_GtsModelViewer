# JAVA_GtsModelViewer
# Goal
This project is a software that can be used to display .gts files that are textual representations of 3D models.
It was developed as part of the DUT (two-year university degree in technology) in 2015, so I was still a beginner in programming.
# Features
- Parse and display .gts files;
- Rotate & translate the model;
- Assign a keyword to each file;
- Search files by keyword;
- Change model color;
- Save current view.
